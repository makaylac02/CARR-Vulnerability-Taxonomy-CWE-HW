* Weakness: CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write


## What it is:

Out of bounds write is when data is written outside of the limits that have been set. When this happens, the program can crash and data can be corrupted. Basically, you try to fit more data in than you have space. It can be as simple as making an array too small, or it can be somewhat complicated and you lose track of what the true value of a variable is after it has made its way through the code. There may be more complicated examples of the vulnerability, but I have not personally coded or dealt with anything too insane.


## Examples + personal experience:

For example, in my early Java days, I may have not grasped the concept that programmers start counting at 0 instead of 1. So when I name and set my array to 10, like this: 

         myArray = new int[10]

 I know the array would have a size of 10. What I wouldn't know is that you would fill the array starting at 0 and ending at 9. So like: 

         myArray[0] = 1 
         ..
         myArray[9] = 10

This is where the out-of-bounds error begins. Beginners may start filling the array starting with 1 and ending with 10. So like:

    myArray[1] = 1
    ..
    my Array[10] = 10

Which is wrong and would attempt to fill an eleventh space in the array, which does not exist, making it an out-of-bounds error.

On the website about this vulenrability, I wanted to mention another example that the website gives. Example 3, specifically. In this example, the program takes in an ip address and leaves a buffer of 64 bytes to store the ip. The issue with this code is that there was nothing put in place to verify that the ip address would be no bigger than 64 bytes. So, this will give attackers the ability to take advantage of the flaw by putting an ip address that is larger than 64 bytes, allowing them to potentially overwrite data. 

## How I could have fixed it:
 A simple fix is to simply understand the size of my data in my code. I have multiple cases of this happening to me. This is not suprising, since this vulnerability is ranked first as one of the most common errors. Luckily, at least most commonly in my own code, it can be a simple fix. Typically I might forget the size of my array in comparison to the size of my data. It can be a simple communication error. In other situations, I often lose track of the size of my data and what the end end value is once its made its way through all the loops in my code. If I have a list of 5 at the start, that is now the size of 8, it may no longer fit into my array at the end. So, I think it is important to comment to my advantage and remind myself what the true value of my variables are. Simple errors can bring simple fixes. Another thing that I think is important to do, is make sure that I have systems in place to check my code. In reference to Example 3, if I am going to take in data then I need to make sure it fits into the space I have set aside for it.
