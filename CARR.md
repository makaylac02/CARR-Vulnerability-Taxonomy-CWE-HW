Weakness: CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write


# What it is:

Out of bounds write is when data is written outside of the limits that have been set. When this happens, the program can crash and data can be corrupted. 


# Examples + personal experience:

For example, in my early Java days, I may have not grasped the concept that programmers start counting at 0. So when I name and set my array to 10, like this: myArray = new int[10], I know the array would have a size of 10. What I wouldn't lnow is that you would fill the array starts at 0 and ending at 9. So like: 

         myArray[0] = 1 
         ..
         myArray[9] = 10

This is where the out-of-bounds error begins. Beginners may start filling the array starting with 1 and ending with 10. So like:

    myArray[1] = 1
    ..
    my Array[10] = 10

Which is wrong and would attempt to fill an eleventh space in the array, which does not exist, making it an out-of-bounds error.

# How I could have fixed it:
 A simple fix is to simply understand the size of my data in my code. I have multiple cases of this happening to me, it is ranked first as one of the most common errors. Luckily, at least in my case, it can be a simple fix. Keeping track of my data and what is adding one and subtracting one to any variables and loops is important. Using comments to keep track of these changes would be useful.
